# Express React Template

Motivation: easily kickstart an express backend with react client.
Uses only `express-generator` and `create-react-app` to combine both technologies with the scripts you know and love:
- `nvm use`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run lint`

### To Run in Production
- `npm run production`
